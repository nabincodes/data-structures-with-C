**Data Structures is that field of computer science which deals with the storage and retrieval of data from memory in the most efficient manner.**


### Data Structures are broadly categorized into two types:
**1. Primitive (Pre-defined) Data Structure:** e.g int,char,float
**2. Non-Primitive (User-defined) Data Structure:** e.g Linear: Array, Structure, Stack, Queue, Linked List and Non-Linear: Tree, Graph, Heap

###Non-Primitive  are further categorized into two types:
**a. Linear Data Structure:** If following one element we have just one element in memory(continuous or non-continuous) then data structure becomes Linear Data Structure. For example: **Array**, **Structure**, **Stack**, **Queue**, **Linked List**.

**b. Non-Linear Data Struture:** If one element in memory is connect to multiple other elements, then the data structure becomes Non-Linear Data Struture. In other words, we can say that if from one element we can migrate to multiple other elements then the data structure is called Non-Linear Data Struture. For example: **Tree**, **Graph**, **Heap**.

## STACK
***
Stack is a linear data structure which is open from one end only. Due to this, all operations like insertion and removal of elements take place from one end only in a stack.

Moreover, to keep track of the position where insertion and deletion will take place, a stack uses a pointer called as "**top of stack(tos)**".

The process of inserting elements in stack is called '**Push**' and removing elements from a stack is called '**Pop**'. Also a stack is said to follow the principle of '**LIFO** - _Last In First Out_' which means that the elements inserted in the last will be deleted first.
